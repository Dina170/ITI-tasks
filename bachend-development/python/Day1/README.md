# Python Lab 1

1. Write a program that counts up the number of vowels [a, e, i, o, u]
   contained in the string

   - Solution: [count_vowels.py](./count_vowels.py)

2. Write a function that accepts two arguments (length, start) to generate
   an array of a specific length filled with integer numbers increased by one
   from start.

   - Solution: [generate_array.py](./generate_array.py)

3. Fill an array of 5 elements from the user, Sort it in descending and
   ascending orders then display the output

   - Solution: [sort_array.py](./sort_array.py)

4. Write a function that takes a number as an argument and if the number
   divisible by 3 return "Fizz" and if it is divisible by 5 return "buzz" and if is is
   divisible by both return "FizzBuzz"

   - Solution: [fizzbuzz.py](./fizzbuzz.py)

5. Write a function which has an input of a string from user then it will
   return the same string reversed

   - Solution: [reverse_string.py](./reverse_string.py)

6. Ask the user to enter the radius of a circle in order to alert its calculated
   area and circumference

   - Solution: [circle_calc.py](./calc_circle.py)

7. Ask the user for his name then confirm that he has entered his name
   (not an empty string/integers). then proceed to ask him for his email and
   print all this data - (Bonus) check if it is a valid email or not

   - Solution: [validate_user.py](./validate_user.py)

8. Write a program that prints the number of times the string 'iti' occurs in
   - Solution: [count_iti.py](./count_iti.py)

- (Bonus) 9 - Write a function that takes a string and prints the longest
  alphabetical ordered substring occured.
  For example, if the string is 'abdulrahman' then the output is:
  Longest substring in alphabetical order is: abdu
  - Solution: [longest_alphabetical.py](./longest_alphabetical.py)
